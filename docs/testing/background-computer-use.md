# Background computer-use validation

Run the source-controlled harness from the repository root:

```bash
scripts/test-background-computer-use.sh
```

It builds the Playground fixture, signs it with the OpenClaw Foundation Developer ID, and samples the already-frontmost
app/window as the sentinel. Before any certifying monitor starts, native background LaunchServices requests
(`open -g -n`) create one task-owned Playground generation and two task-owned TextEdit generations. Exact before/after
application-inventory deltas, native process-start identities, and exact visible windows establish ownership. Every
setup launch must leave the sentinel unchanged; the harness never foregrounds a fixture and never "restores" a stale
foreground app after setup.

The live matrix also requires one already-running process with one exact key or sole visible window for Safari,
Calendar, System Settings, Calculator, and Finder. Activity Monitor instead uses the catalog's source-controlled exact
application/window title to distinguish its main window from `Dock Icon Host Window`. Those six processes are read-only
prerequisites: the harness never launches, quits, closes, or otherwise mutates them. Together with the owned Playground
and TextEdit targets, eight monitored screenshot-only exact-window cells prove cross-app routing without focus or
cursor control.
Missing processes, duplicate instances, ambiguous windows, process-generation drift, or changed window receipts fail
closed rather than selecting a first match. The exact-title route accepts a complete warning-free inventory or one
partial inventory whose only warning proves that the omitted rows were non-renderable or duplicate; every other partial
or malformed inventory is refused. The same exact selector and PID generation must still match after observation.

The remaining cases exercise fresh, exact PID/window snapshots through `see` (including AX-only and screenshot-only
modes), `capture live`, click by ID and query, exact-window `type`, `press`, and `paste`, app/PID-only raw-press refusal,
`set-value`, `action`, and targeted background scroll. Stale snapshots and unsupported named AX actions must
fail nonzero instead of falling back to foreground synthesis. Standard targeted scroll must report Accessibility
delivery and produce an independent, PID-scoped Playground offset change; controlled WebKit fixtures may instead
report exact-window routed, unverifiable delivery and must prove the offset independently before any retry.
The monitored lifecycle phase uses the already-owned TextEdit receipts, establishes a non-maximized exact frame, then
maximizes and closes one window. Quit accepts exactly two tuples: confirmed success with the target process gone, or
`suspected_noop`/`INTERACTION_FAILED` with that target still alive. The harness does not infer the state of an unrelated
sibling process from the quit result. Cleanup passes every task-owned PID and process-start identity in one
generation-pinned `app quit` request; it never mints ownership from a bare post-launch PID or issues an unpinned quit
that could hit a recycled process.

PID-only typing is deliberately refused once Playground has multiple eligible windows. Exact-window typing succeeds
only after one background semantic click establishes the fixture focus. Exact-window raw Return then exercises the
receipt-pinned background press route and requires an independent PID-scoped submit log. The same raw press with only
an app or PID must refuse before dispatch with foreground-consent guidance. Fixture windows open through background
semantic menu actions rather than uncertified shortcuts. The harness invokes the current CLI directly and uses no
AppleScript or JXA.

Playground exposes a PID-scoped OSLog event oracle for adjunct middle-click and held-pointer qualification. Its closed
local monitor covers only left, right, and center-button mouse-down and mouse-up. Each event message is one closed JSON
record with exactly `sequence`, `button`, `phase`, and `window_id`; the surrounding unified-log record supplies the
exact Playground process ID. The 42-case matrix and live-v4 coordinator do not collect or validate these records. The
separate final physical-qualification procedure must query them by the exact Playground PID: middle-click evidence is
one consecutive middle down/up pair with the same window ID. Held-pointer evidence uses the same already-signed,
source-bound `peekaboo-certification-controller` built for live-v4 with its `--held-pointer-plan` mode. That mode performs
two complete exact-window inventories, creates one owner, begins and releases the hold, and disconnects the owner while
exporting the ordered six listener-signed receipts. Qualification additionally requires the corresponding consecutive
left down/up Playground records, exact process-generation readback before and after, semantic restoration, and a clean
DiagnosticReports comparison. No standalone held-pointer helper, separate signing ceremony, or helper custody chain is
part of the contract. Neither the app log nor controller result alone proves both application handling and release.

Playground's existing `Key` log also appends the raw received modifier flags to every key-down, key-up, and
flags-changed event, together with its event window number, the app's current key-window number, app activation state,
and the key window's text-editor selection as UTF-16 location/length. Event and key-window IDs are separate evidence;
the logger does not infer that a PID-routed event belongs to the key window. Missing or non-text responders and known
secure field editors report `keySelection: unavailable`, not an empty selection. These are passive pre-handler samples:
the monitor returns the original event unchanged, and the next independent UI read must establish the resulting effect.
The appended metadata contains no field text and does not change the existing human key description or on-screen log.
Query the exact fixture PID and time interval; a received character alone does not prove received Command modifiers,
shortcut handling, or global modifier release.

The owner-private held-pointer plan binds the same exact signed controller build and protocol-1.30 Bridge host as live-v4,
one visible exact PID/generation/window/bounds target, one in-bounds global point, a fixed 500 ms hold, and a fresh artifact
directory. The controller derives an RFC 9562 UUIDv8 client identity from the execution nonce, so every listener-signed
operation receipt is cryptographically run-bound. Run the physical lifecycle only after the final Bridge listener and
controlled Playground target are ready:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "execution_nonce": "64-lowercase-hex",
  "socket_path": "/absolute/path/to/bridge.sock",
  "trusted_bridge_host_team_ids": ["TENCHARID1"],
  "expected_controller_build": {
    "source_commit": "40-lowercase-hex",
    "executable_path": "/absolute/path/to/peekaboo-certification-controller",
    "executable_sha256": "64-lowercase-hex",
    "team_id": "TENCHARID1"
  },
  "expected_host": {
    "host_kind": "gui",
    "process_identifier": 100,
    "process_start_identity_decimal": "100001",
    "code_signature_hash": "40-lowercase-hex",
    "source_commit": "40-lowercase-hex"
  },
  "target": {
    "process_identifier": 200,
    "process_start_identity_decimal": "200001",
    "window_id": 300,
    "bounds": {"x": 10, "y": 20, "width": 640, "height": 480},
    "is_minimized": false,
    "click_point": {"x": 330, "y": 260}
  },
  "hold_milliseconds": 500,
  "artifacts_directory": "/private/path/to/new-empty-held-pointer-artifacts"
}
```

```bash
peekaboo-certification-controller \
  --held-pointer-plan /private/path/to/held-pointer-plan.json
```

Success writes `held-pointer-receipt.json` plus exactly six bundles in `bundles/`, ordered as two window inventories,
owner creation, begin, release, and owner disconnect. The begin receipt must attest two background window-targeted units;
release must attest one additional unit and the three-unit `released` lifecycle; disconnect must attest zero dispatch.
Validate every retained bundle against the still-live exact Bridge listener before sealing final evidence.

The inventory, owner-creation, and completed owner-disconnect receipts have signed `global` scope. This is not
foreground input: those operations carry no concrete window identity in the receipt itself. The two authenticated
inventory responses must independently identify the same complete exact target, including its generation and bounds;
begin and release carry exact-window receipt scope. An idle disconnect returns no concrete action target while still
signing `global` scope. Missing receipt scope is not equivalent to that explicit value, and a later evidence error must
not repeat an already-acknowledged owner disconnect.

Certification requires a stamped CLI whose `--version --json` output contains one canonical 40-hex `sourceCommit`.
Remote certification pins every command to one exact Bridge socket and requires its additive host-identity receipt to
expose the same source commit. Raw SwiftPM and manual unstamped Xcode builds report `unknown` and are intentionally
refused for certification. The validated certification report records both stamps and rejects missing or mismatched
provenance when artifacts are replayed. Every monitored case brackets its command with exact socket, PID, and
process-generation attestations; a restarted or rebound Bridge host invalidates that case. The report also commits
pre/post CLI and Bridge executable SHA-256, CDHash, device, and inode receipts. Catalog, reporter, probe, and harness
inputs are copied into the owner-private run root before execution and verified unchanged afterward. Playground carries
an embedded current-commit/source-tree manifest beneath the app signature, so a prebuilt fixture cannot claim the
checkout's source merely because its bundle identifier matches.

Every background case starts only after the 10 ms monitor completes its first sample and publishes a sequence
heartbeat. After the command and its restoration checks finish, the case waits for that sequence to advance again; an
alive but wedged watcher cannot certify a pass. The case also fails if the monitor does not remain alive until the
harness terminates it, or if Peekaboo changes the sentinel PID/top window, the clipboard leaks, or a new visible
Peekaboo window appears. Physical cursor coordinates are observational because the user may move the mouse while the
matrix runs. The probe records `cursorMovementObserved`; hardware-origin `mouseMoved` events from PID 0 neither fail nor
contaminate a row. User clicks, keys, wheel input, attribution loss, and focus changes remain contamination. A passive
native event tap correlates product input with exact command/Bridge-host PID and
process-generation receipts. An acknowledged producer event that reaches the session-global tap violates the catalog's
`global_input_event` invariant; legitimate background PID-targeted delivery does not traverse that tap. All other input
makes the attempt sticky-indeterminate. An activation or focused-window notification accompanied by that external input
is part of the same contamination; without external input it violates the matching focus invariant. The tap requests
the complete non-null event mask and verifies that macOS retained the required mouse, keyboard, scroll, and tablet bits;
missing listen access, a reduced tap, disablement, or event overflow blocks certification. The original focus baseline
is never rebased into a pass; no cursor-position equality is required. The catalog's
`producer_pointer_event` slot means Peekaboo emitted no attributable shared-pointer route, not that the user
kept the mouse still. When observational cursor policy is disabled, coordinate drift is reported separately as the
out-of-catalog `cursor_position` violation, which still fails the harness without blaming Peekaboo for the user's input.
A pre-command attempt can be discarded and restarted from a fresh baseline, with
three total attempts. After dispatch, only catalog rows with a named replay-safe reset contract may rerun the whole row; mutation rows
such as click, type, paste, close, and quit block instead. Disabled attribution, event overflow, or retry exhaustion also
blocks the row instead of silently passing or blaming unrelated motion on Peekaboo. Clipboard and overlay invariants
remain active even on a contaminated interactive sample. The harness does not save and unconditionally restore a
run-start clipboard snapshot, so a newer user clipboard is never overwritten during cleanup; the paste command's own
transaction must restore its temporary payload. Clipboard
contents are hashed, never printed. Selected mutations use fresh UI readback or PID-scoped Playground log checks and
deltas; result contracts cover the remaining cases. Only exact declared or controlled target windows are collected;
their screenshot artifacts can contain visible local app content and must remain private. Unrelated windows are not
captured. Artifact directories must be new or empty so a rerun cannot reuse old summaries, images, or logs. Results go under
the owner-only `.artifacts/background-computer-use/<UTC>/` root.

The native monitor has one authorization-epoch state machine for producer publication and all input, activation, and
focused-window callbacks. Each callback is admitted on one atomic cutoff and retains that epoch plus the PID,
process-start identity, and focused window sampled during the callback. Admission reserves a cheap immutable token,
releases the publication lock while sampling native process/focus evidence, and completes that exact token afterward;
sealed epochs cannot reach a heartbeat while any reservation remains incomplete. Input and activation callbacks use
exact Accessibility focus lookup rather than a broad WindowServer inventory. Each window lookup is bracketed by matching
process-generation reads; generation drift discards the combined evidence instead of synthesizing a PID/window pair.
Publishing a higher producer revision closes the old epoch before the new epoch can admit evidence; heartbeat closure
uses the same cutoff, so there is no separate drain-to-heartbeat interval. Each heartbeat samples system state, drains
callbacks that became ready during sampling, and only then closes/evaluates that epoch. Every higher revision is a
transition barrier, including a producer-only update or
an unchanged foreground target. A separate full callback run-loop turn and `beforeWaiting` idle barrier must finish before
that revision becomes eligible for acknowledgement. A missed bounded idle barrier defers the transition while stable
monitoring continues; persistent backlog eventually times out the harness acknowledgement wait rather than relabeling
queued callbacks. Admission remains on the previously acknowledged policy through that barrier. A grant therefore cannot
credit its new controller early, while a queued event from the prior grant is neither relabeled nor treated as outside
input during
revoke. The monitor will not publish an acknowledgement while its pre-ack bucket has a pending reservation or unevaluated
event. Once that bucket is empty, observer reconciliation, the atomic heartbeat write, and the admission switch to the
new authorization share one cutoff. Heartbeat bytes and the same-directory temporary file are prepared outside the
cutoff, then a final adjacent terminal-order idle barrier requires two `beforeWaiting` passes so work queued by another
observer receives one more drain turn; any resulting evidence defers acknowledgement again. Current and prior controller
generations and targets are revalidated inside the cutoff before observer retirement
and atomic rename, so liveness cannot drift during the final barrier. Every evaluated transition summary is still published
with `transitionAcknowledged: false` while waiting, so activation/focus counts are never discarded. The eventual
acknowledgement advertises the new revision and target but cannot advance `lastCleanSequence`; the next fully closed stable
epoch may do so. Repeating the current revision is idempotent only when the exact producer set (ignoring array order) and
optional foreground payload are unchanged.

The producer document may label one exact process generation with role `foreground-controller` and pair it with
`foreground: {active: true, target: {pid, startIdentity, windowID}}`. A foreground grant requires exactly one such
controller and at least one ordinary Bridge producer; inactive policy permits neither a controller nor a target. The
baseline focus observer remains installed, a new granted-target observer is installed before publication, and observers
for prior targets remain alive while transition evidence is evaluated. They retire inside the acknowledgement cutoff;
removal or final liveness failure prevents the acknowledgement, publishes a non-acknowledging heartbeat, and records a
sticky attribution failure without terminating the watcher. Every heartbeat revalidates all effective and pending
foreground-controller generations even when no input arrived; ordinary Bridge generations remain publication-validated
and event-time validated because short-lived CLI producers may exit before the post-command heartbeat. Foreground-activity
counters are scoped to the advertised revision so an earlier grant cannot satisfy a later grant. Controller recycling or
current/deferred target generation or window drift disables attribution. Hardware-origin mouse movement may be recorded as
observational when the harness opts in; other user input still makes the attempt indeterminate.

Every heartbeat is bound to one 64-hex execution nonce, one UUIDv4 monitor instance, and one SHA-256 history
commitment. Closed heartbeats use safe-integer `monotonicMicroseconds` for strict ordering and
`wallClockMilliseconds` for signed-receipt interval comparison; adjacent fence deltas may differ by at most two seconds,
so a wall-clock jump fails closed. Fractional timestamps remain diagnostic-only and never enter sealed evidence.
Producer documents carry the same run identity and use a closed schema. The source-owned live coordinator
can additionally start an owner-private Unix attestation socket. After the monitor matches six ordered certification
fences against heartbeats it actually published, it seals the exact coordinator corpus, rewrites the final heartbeat
to the sealed history commitment, and serves a newline-delimited challenge response containing its PID generation,
code-signature hash, and domain-separated `monitor-evidence` digest. The controller verifies the kernel Unix peer PID;
writing heartbeat, evidence, or receipt files cannot mint monitor authority.

The standalone probe's `monitor-evidence-v2-digest` helper is deliberately scoped to this closed integer-only monitor
schema. It sorts decoded object keys by ECMAScript UTF-16 order, retains source-owned Node integer tokens, and rejects
fractions, exponents, negative zero, duplicate keys, and integers outside JavaScript's safe range. The general digest
specification remains implemented by the Node finalizer; this native helper does not claim to canonicalize arbitrary
JSON numbers.

The 42-case matrix does not grant a foreground controller; its default remains background-only. Concurrent certification
is a separate source-owned coordinator workflow and requires the run-bound seal, PID attestation, signed receipts, and
foreground semantic witness together. The matrix therefore does not pass the five live-seal paths or claim a v4 live
certificate. The probe's deterministic tests exercise the seal and peer-PID endpoint; the dependent live coordinator
owns the six-fence execution. Epoch heartbeats alone are not a concurrent certification.

The 42 required CLI cases are source-controlled in the version 2
`scripts/background-computer-use-catalog.json`. Each row declares
its exit contract and, where applicable, its effect, delivery, refusal code, allowed outcome tuples, and named checks.
The catalog is the canonical list of monitored invariant families and projects their names into the native probe,
harness summaries, synthetic fixtures, and reporter. The harness writes one exact array of closed `{name, passed}`
results per case, preserving duplicate names so the reporter can reject them after ordinary JSON parsing. The reporter
`scripts/validate-background-computer-use-report.mjs` rejects missing, duplicate, or unknown rows; surface, command, or
phase drift; wrong refusal codes; disallowed conditional outcomes; effect or delivery drift; absent declared
readback/log/artifact evidence; physical-app identity or coverage drift; monitor failure; and every missing, unknown, or
violated catalog invariant. A legacy aggregate violation count cannot certify a row. Command and phase identity are
derived from the actual harness arguments rather than copied from the catalog, so adding `--foreground` invalidates a
background row. The stale-snapshot row resizes the exact captured window under the same monitor, requires
`SNAPSHOT_STALE` when reusing that real snapshot ID, and restores the original bounds before the case can pass. A run is
not certified merely because the cases that happened to execute passed. The machine-readable verdict is
`certification.json` beside the normal summary.

Completeness is relative to this source-controlled 42-case single-controller matrix; it is not a claim that every
Peekaboo CLI combination is represented. Live concurrent certification is a separate source-owned workflow. It runs
two long-lived, exact-window background controllers plus an independent foreground semantic observer through the same
authenticated Bridge listener. Each controller publishes four signed slots: type mutation, protocol-1.30 triple click,
checkpoint observation, and final-bounds observation.

The version-4 contract distinguishes the protocol-1.30 host handshake from the protocol-1.29 receipt floor. It binds
controller/client process generations, signed request sessions, exact window identities and bounds, canonical
request/response digests, source builds, intervals, and outcomes. The monitor corpus contains exactly six stable fences:
`baseline-stable`, `grant-stable`, `operations-start`, `operations-complete`, `revoke-stable`, and `final-stable`.
Attributed foreground activity is zero at every fence except `operations-complete`, where it must be positive and come
only from the contracted foreground-controller PID while both designated background mutations remain in flight.

The foreground observer is a third signed controller process. Before execution, its plan commits the exact window,
semantic role plus title and/or identifier, expected value derived from the run nonce, baseline value, and owner-private
artifact paths. It performs a fresh signed readback during the overlap bracket and proves restoration afterward. The
monitor also commits crash inventory, sentinel and clipboard state, producer revisions, all six fences, and restoration.
The closed crash-report prefix set covers `Playground`, the fixture's resolved executable name, and retains the legacy
`PeekabooPlayground` watch entry.
Separate owner-private Unix sockets challenge the live monitor and observer by kernel peer PID before and after final
validation; caller-written files alone never mint authority.

Run the lifecycle with one closed owner-private plan:

```bash
node scripts/run-live-multi-target-certification.mjs \
  --plan /private/path/to/live-coordinator-plan.json
```

The former documented entry point remains as a migration wrapper. Its `--self-test` mode runs the replacement
deterministic certification gate; old live flags fail with the owner-private plan command above instead of silently
attempting the weaker pre-v4 workflow:

```bash
scripts/test-dual-controller-overlap.sh --self-test
scripts/test-dual-controller-overlap.sh --self-test --artifacts /private/path/to/empty-artifacts
```

JSONL stdout begins with `run-created`, then emits bounded `external-foreground-window` events for the exact foreground
task and restoration. The external controller must exclusively write the named task-complete and restore-complete
markers with the supplied nonce and monitor UUID. A production `completed` event is certification-eligible only after
monitor sealing, both PID-bound challenges, `prepare`, final `finalize`, and child release all succeed. Test-runtime
fixtures instead emit `test-runtime-complete` with `certification_eligible:false`; no plan field, persisted summary,
fixture, or caller-written success value can certify a run.

The source-blind lifecycle contract is in
`tests/contracts/live-multi-target-certification-coordinator.md`. The finalizer and digest tools are also directly
available for owner-private artifacts:

```bash
node scripts/finalize-multi-target-certification.mjs prepare \
  --controller-receipts /private/path/to/controller-receipts \
  --bundles /private/path/to/raw-bundles \
  --monitor-evidence /private/path/to/monitor-evidence.json \
  --foreground-postcondition /private/path/to/foreground-postcondition.json \
  --artifacts /private/path/to/artifacts \
  --peekaboo /absolute/path/to/signed/peekaboo

node scripts/finalize-multi-target-certification.mjs verify-digests \
  --artifacts /private/path/to/artifacts \
  --summary /private/path/to/certification-summary.json
```

The final live finalizer exit is authoritative. The persisted summary is display-only and has no top-level `success` or
`certified` field. Its freshly recomputed `offline_protocol_validation.success` is only a receipt-protocol sub-gate;
`verify-digests.success` means only that documented digest projections match.

The source-owned release-qualification layer in `scripts/final-qualification/` composes that authoritative local run
with the real Agent/integrated-Computer-Use overlap, five 42-case cycles, adjunct evidence, and two-host deployment
proof. Its version-2 manifest requires byte-identical normalized local/Studio installed inventories, both elevation
receipts, and complete local+Studio before/during/after process trees collected from explicitly named task roots. It
requires the Agent's ordered `target-a`/`target-b` actions to use the same exact PID-generation-window targets owned by
the live-v4 controllers, corroborates their full target digests in the source-owned final summary, and retains the two
derived bindings directly in the manifest. The local/during tree must also identify both target generations as signed
candidate Playground fixture roots. Consistently resealing caller-authored traces, bundles, or readbacks around an
unrelated, swapped, recycled-generation, or different window cannot satisfy those independent owners. It
rejects any task-owned root or descendant using CUA, AppleScript/JXA/OSA interpreters, virtualization, VNC, Screen
Sharing, or remote-desktop helpers, while unrelated ambient services remain outside its closed tree and are never
stopped. A separate bound executable/script policy report covers in-process native paths that ancestry alone cannot
prove. Every final matrix run uses `--qualification-cycle 1...5` to add one signed-Playground alert lifecycle after the
fixed 42 rows: background Show Alert, exact sheet observation, alternating background OK/Cancel dismissal, and a fresh
complete AX-only See with no dialog remaining. The harness retains and hashes raw CLI, monitor, timing, process, signed
Bridge-bundle, and live-validator artifacts; final manifest generation and verification re-read and authenticate them
instead of trusting copied summary fields. The initial screenshot See must remain below the overall 2.5-second budget,
while the final native AX-only See must remain below 1.5 seconds. The cycle's zero-delta DiagnosticReports comparison
must bracket that trigger, so a clean crash scan without exercising the reported alert/dismiss/AX-refresh path cannot
certify. See `scripts/final-qualification/README.md` for the exact schemas and commands.

For the interaction commands exercised here, background is the omission contract: `--foreground` is the only consent
for focus/activation, global keyboard input, physical cursor movement, or synthetic pointer/wheel events. Explicit app
switching and other inherently foreground commands are outside that statement. The optional physical phase is separate:

```bash
scripts/test-background-computer-use.sh --foreground-phase
```

That opt-in phase intentionally controls the shared cursor. It restores the prior cursor and sentinel only when their
current values still match Peekaboo's last write; a concurrent user change is newer state and is never overwritten. The
phase is not part of the default background certification and should run only on an otherwise idle desktop.
Do not move Dock items, switch Spaces, or open file dialogs in this harness; those belong in explicitly destructive or
interactive test plans.

For a fast helper check with no GUI automation:

```bash
scripts/test-background-computer-use.sh --self-test
```

That self-test also validates a complete synthetic certification report. The reporter's fail-closed corruptions run in
the normal safe gate or directly with `pnpm run test:background-certification`; they cover deleted, duplicate, unknown,
wrong-refusal, missing-evidence, disallowed conditional-outcome, effect/delivery-drift, catalog invariant corruption,
duplicate/missing/unknown/violated invariant results, legacy object/aggregate shapes, and invariant-canary reports.

Use `--bin`, `--artifacts`, `--sentinel-bundle-id`, or `--playground-app ... --skip-playground-build` to select an exact
binary, require an already-frontmost app, or use a prebuilt signed fixture. The harness refuses rather than activating a
requested sentinel that is not already frontmost; the sentinel must not be any of the eight physical targets. Before a
live run, leave exactly one visible key or sole window open for Safari, Calendar, System Settings, Calculator, Activity
Monitor, and Finder; Activity Monitor may also retain auxiliary windows when exactly one visible window matches the
catalog title. Add `--no-remote` when the exact CLI is team-signed and
has local TCC grants; this prevents an installed bridge host from masking working-tree behavior. A prebuilt app must
have the OpenClaw Foundation team signature and the exact current-source `PeekabooPlaygroundSource.json` manifest;
ad-hoc or unstamped fixtures are rejected. Build it with `scripts/build-playground-artifact.sh`, then use the terminal
artifact finalizer for signing and notarization. Manifest schema v2 binds the fixture to `source_commit`, the
`Apps/Playground` source tree, marketing version, configuration, bundle identifier, root workspace/scheme, and the path
plus SHA-256 of the tracked canonical `Apps/Peekaboo.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/swiftpm/Package.resolved`. It also records
the canonical Developer directory and exact Xcode, macOS SDK, and Swift compiler versions. Standalone Playground
lockfiles are not accepted. The native preflight and terminal finalizer share the strict v2 receipt validator in
`scripts/source-provenance.sh`: exactly one JSON object with the 14 documented fields, numeric schema version 2,
and an immutable regular receipt. Native preflight independently checks the clean current checkout, exact Playground
tree, tracked unchanged canonical lock, selected toolchain, and actual bundle identifier/version/executable metadata.
It verifies the app with `codesign --verify --deep --strict` and an Apple-anchored requirement for the OpenClaw Foundation
Developer ID, team `FWJYW4S8P8`, and Debug identifier `boo.peekaboo.playground.debug`. Supplied artifacts are never
restamped, normalized, or re-signed.

The default local build still uses the standalone Playground project and creates a v1 receipt. That narrow exception
belongs only to the fresh app built and signed by the current harness invocation; it retains exact current commit/tree,
bundle metadata, and Foundation signature checks. A supplied v1 app is refused, even if it was built by an earlier
harness invocation. There is no environment variable or flag that grants local-build ownership.

To validate a supplied fixture without running the live harness:

```bash
scripts/test-background-computer-use.sh --validate-playground-only \
  --playground-app /absolute/path/Playground.app --skip-playground-build
```

This uses the same production preflight and exits before probe compilation/execution, CLI or Bridge calls, permissions,
keychain lookup, artifact setup, launches, or cleanup traps. Toolchain queries use the selected `DEVELOPER_DIR` (or
`xcode-select -p`), canonicalized before comparison. External-tool doubles are accepted only in explicit headless test
mode and are rejected on live paths. The live report's closed source evidence includes `source_provenance_sha256`;
the helper is privately snapshotted, checked for drift, and verified against retained helper bytes by the reporter.

Final terminal qualification also requires `--terminal-artifact-manifest` beside the prebuilt Playground. Portable schema 7
binds the zipped app, its exact post-staple tree receipt, Foundation identity/notary receipt, and the pinned universal
Node 26.9.0 qualification app. **That terminal-manifest/pinned-Node integration is not yet implemented by this native
harness; fixture validation alone does not establish terminal qualification.** The qualification consumer must extract
and verify that Node app before any candidate action and run
qualification JavaScript only with `PeekabooQualificationNode.app/Contents/MacOS/node`; ambient `node`, PATH, and an
OpenClaw installation are not fallbacks. Terminal app payloads permit no extended attributes, `__MACOSX`, or `._*`
AppleDouble entries, and every ZIP must reproduce the retained canonical tree byte-for-byte.
The retained receipts also preserve the exact notarization submissions, bind every universal Mach-O architecture,
anchor the controller/monitor source aggregate inside signed code, and require the final DMG to remount with the exact
notarized Peekaboo app and no unapproved root payloads.

The synthetic `scripts/test-terminal-manifest-portability.sh` fixture copies disposable, metadata-bearing inputs without
extended attributes before setting source modes to 444/555 and recording trees or packaging archives. Its final synthetic
DMG is read-only before receipt binding so verification mounts cannot add checksum cache attributes. Validation and
relocation must preserve the candidate's bytes, modes, and absence of xattrs; metadata is never cleared from a sealed
candidate. Run it in a macOS environment whose shell and Node runtime create xattr-free temporary files and directories;
a host that adds provenance to those nodes still fails the strict policy, even in a headless shell. The test also covers
byte, symlink, and xattr tampering without live signing.
