# `peekaboo mcp`

`mcp` runs Peekaboo as a Model Context Protocol server. `peekaboo mcp` defaults to `serve`, so you can launch the server without specifying a subcommand.

## Subcommands
| Name | Purpose | Key options |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `serve` | Run Peekaboo’s MCP server over stdio. | `--transport stdio` (default); `--allow-foreground` explicitly authorizes foreground/global UI, including browser connection setup, for this server process; global `--bridge-socket <path>` attaches to an existing Bridge host. HTTP/SSE names and `--port` are reserved for future support and currently fail with an actionable error. |

## Implementation notes
- `serve` instantiates `PeekabooMCPServer` and maps the transport string to `PeekabooCore.TransportType`. Stdio is the default for Claude Code integrations.
- Public MCP servers are background-only by default. Foreground actions, shared desktop input, and browser connection
  setup fail before dispatch unless a human starts that server process with `--allow-foreground`. Each server whose
  catalog includes `browser`, or which consumes an explicit browser handoff, owns a fresh browser child and does not
  borrow another CLI, daemon, or MCP caller's connection. Scoped MCP page actions never ambiently auto-connect, even
  with foreground authority. `--allow-foreground` exposes the explicit `browser` `connect` action for that exact child
  and browser routes that can enter Puppeteer evaluation. The pinned provider marks those evaluations as user gestures
  even for background or headless pages, so default servers hide and pre-dispatch refuse page discovery, snapshots,
  navigation, waits, element interaction, and arbitrary script evaluation. Foreground-authorized calls reuse the scoped
  connection and truthfully report foreground browser-protocol delivery; this classification does not claim the page
  was visibly fronted.
  Authenticated sessions reject `PEEKABOO_BROWSER_MCP_ISOLATED=1` before provider startup because that child has no
  pinnable browser identity. For headless use, launch Chrome separately and pass its exact loopback `browser_url`.
  This explicit authority never exposes Shell, and a nested Agent remains background-only. A background-only
  Bridge-backed opaque browser session can start connected only through `--browser-handoff <absolute-private-path>`
  together with exactly one matching `--bridge-socket`. The receipt must first be created by an explicit foreground
  `peekaboo browser connect --handoff-file` against that same socket. A current Bridge consumes the signed receipt once,
  authenticates its caller, listener generation, exact target, claim, and provider epoch, then gives this MCP server a
  distinct scoped provider child. The background server starts with that inherited exact connection and does not
  expose `browser connect` or fall back to the Bridge root. Missing, stale, mismatched, consumed, or downgraded
  handoffs fail before provider dispatch.
- Direct-text `paste` is admitted only with an exact generation-pinned app/PID/window authorization and a canonical
  background result. Targetless, foreground, current-clipboard, and binary paste are refused before dispatch. The
  nested `agent` tool likewise retains immutable background-only authority and never exposes Shell.
- HTTP/SSE server transports are reserved but not implemented. Selecting either fails before daemon startup and emits a structured error in JSON mode.
- The MCP process owns its stdio lifecycle and never hosts a Bridge listener. Support stays process-local by default;
  an explicit `--bridge-socket <path>` uses that existing Bridge host and skips the embedded daemon.
- An explicit `--bridge-socket` binds caller-side capture preflight and every later request to that socket's
  authenticated process generation; unrelated auxiliary sockets cannot freeze the MCP session. The selected host still
  must advertise process ownership, then enforces the canonical process-lifetime ScreenCaptureKit lease at every SCK
  leaf by scanning all same-user potential Peekaboo processes. Reentry refuses owner-unaware processes discovered later.
  Modern refusal remains a signed `CAPTURE_FAILED` / `runtime_incompatible`, retry-safe, not-dispatched result instead
  of being rewritten as a target-attribution error. `see` can use `capture_engine: "classic"` without entering
  ScreenCaptureKit. Caller-local MCP keeps the broader startup scan because it has no external Bridge generation to own
  capture.
- The native tool catalog includes bounded `capture` for live screen/window/region recording or video ingest. It writes retained frames, `contact.png`, `metadata.json`, and optional MP4 output. Frame/contact metadata carries capture-session-authored SHA-256 custody, projected as `artifact_sha256`, and success revalidates those bytes plus semantic metadata. Use tool allow/deny filters when exposing MCP to untrusted clients.
- An explicit environment allowlist containing only tools proven unable to capture pixels, such as
  `PEEKABOO_ALLOW_TOOLS=browser`, skips ScreenCaptureKit owner selection at startup. Missing allowlists, unknown tools,
  nested `agent`, and any capture-capable tool remain fail-closed behind the normal owner preflight.
- MCP resolves its filtered tool catalog before browser bootstrap. Filtering out `browser` therefore creates no browser
  child and lets browser-free catalogs start against legacy remote providers. An explicit `--browser-handoff` is still
  authenticated, consumed, and opened even when `browser` is filtered out, so one-shot authority is never silently
  ignored; the filtered browser tool remains unavailable.
- An explicitly selected current GUI Bridge can serve the default catalog, including its own isolated browser scope,
  when the host negotiates browser-session support and every required operation is enabled. Starting that scope does
  not connect Chrome or borrow another caller's connection. Older or restricted hosts still refuse unsupported browser
  bootstrap; use `PEEKABOO_DISABLE_TOOLS=browser` for a native-only catalog when no browser handoff is requested.
- UI automation tools include action-first additions: `set_value` directly mutates a settable accessibility value, and `action` invokes a named accessibility action on an element from `see`.
- `verify_state` replaces fixed sleeps with bounded native polling. It resolves an app or PID to one exact window, evaluates 1–8 AND predicates for window existence/bounds or exact AX element existence/value/enabled/selected state every 100 ms, and reports `satisfied`, `unsatisfied`, or conservative `unknown` after at most 10 seconds. Explicit PIDs and app-name selectors are pinned to the first resolved PID/process-start generation for the whole invocation; relaunch, PID reuse, and selector drift are `unknown`. Exact-window ownership is rechecked on every sample and before an optional screenshot, whose capture metadata must confirm the same PID and window ID. A directly read value matching a unique exact AX identifier can satisfy an `element_value` predicate when unrelated AX siblings are unreadable; missing, mismatched, non-identifier, or ambiguous partial-tree evidence remains `unknown`. A WindowServer miss is corroborated with a complete app-scoped window inventory before Peekaboo reports absence, preserving minimized AX windows. Ownership ambiguity, partial enumeration, or identity changes are `unknown`. It never focuses or replays actions.
- `click` preserves element IDs and queries when forwarding to automation, so action-first policy can use accessibility actions before synthetic fallback.

## Examples
```bash
# Start the Peekaboo MCP server (defaults to stdio)
peekaboo mcp

# Explicit transport selection
peekaboo mcp serve --transport stdio

# Explicitly authorize this server to connect its own scoped browser child
peekaboo mcp serve --allow-foreground

# Route MCP tools through an existing Bridge host
peekaboo mcp serve --bridge-socket "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Peekaboo/bridge.sock"

# Transfer one exact foreground-approved browser connection into a background Bridge-scoped MCP server
# Mode 0700 is necessary but not sufficient: the parent and receipt must also have zero extended ACLs/xattrs.
mkdir -m 700 /private/tmp/peekaboo-browser-handoff
peekaboo browser connect --channel stable --foreground \
  --bridge-socket "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Peekaboo/bridge.sock" \
  --handoff-file /private/tmp/peekaboo-browser-handoff/receipt.json
peekaboo mcp serve \
  --bridge-socket "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Peekaboo/bridge.sock" \
  --browser-handoff /private/tmp/peekaboo-browser-handoff/receipt.json
```

Handoff storage requires a current-user-owned parent directory with mode `0700` and a current-user-owned regular,
single-link receipt with mode `0600`. Both must have zero extended ACLs and zero extended attributes, including OS
provenance; symlink paths are refused. `mkdir -m 700` establishes the parent mode only and is not sufficient proof of
admission. Newly created directories and files can carry OS metadata, and mode changes do not remove it. Detected
attributes, detected ACLs, and inspection failures have distinct diagnostics naming the parent or receipt, without
reading or printing attribute values. These diagnostics do not make metadata-producing environments compatible:
handoff remains fail-closed with no fallback, and receipt loading fails before runtime construction.

The `see` tool publishes a closed `capture_engine` choice: `auto` (default), `modern`, or `classic`. `classic` is the
request-local no-ScreenCaptureKit recovery path and remains bound to the same selected Bridge host.

An MCP client can wait for stable native state without interrupting the user:

```json
{
  "app": "TextEdit",
  "predicates": [
    {
      "kind": "element_value",
      "selector": { "identifier": "document-content" },
      "expected_value": "Ready"
    },
    { "kind": "window_exists", "expected": true }
  ],
  "stable_samples": 2,
  "timeout_ms": 5000
}
```

## Troubleshooting
- Verify Screen Recording + Accessibility permissions (`peekaboo permissions status`).
- Confirm your process with `peekaboo app list`, its exact window with `peekaboo window list`, and current UI with `peekaboo see` before rerunning.
- Re-run with `--json` or `--verbose` to surface detailed errors.
