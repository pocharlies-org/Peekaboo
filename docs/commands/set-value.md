# `peekaboo set-value`

`set-value` writes an accessibility value directly to a settable element. It is the CLI equivalent of the MCP `set_value` tool and avoids keyboard synthesis, cursor movement, input-method timing, and autocomplete side effects when replacement semantics are intended.

## Options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `<value>` | String value to write. |
| `--on <id-or-query>` | Element ID from `peekaboo see`, or a query used by the automation service. Required. |
| `--snapshot <id>` | Snapshot ID from `peekaboo see`; uses the latest unmodified UI snapshot when omitted. |
| Target flags | `--app`, `--pid`, `--window-id`, `--window-title`, and `--window-index` scope the mutation without activating the app. |
| `--foreground` | Explicitly focus the target before mutation and allow web-content discovery to focus the page when required. |

## Notes

- The target element must expose a settable accessibility value.
- A concrete `--snapshot` already identifies the app and window; do not combine it with target flags. Omit the concrete snapshot (or use `--snapshot latest`) when supplying target flags to capture a fresh targeted snapshot. Conflicts return `INVALID_INPUT` with a retry-safe, non-dispatched refusal before runtime discovery.
- Numeric controls retain native numeric verification, including floating-point rounding tolerance; numeric-looking
  text remains literal. Successful output reports the observed value, not a replacement copy of the requested value.
- Boolean verification requires an actual Boolean or exact numeric `0`/`1`; fractional values are not truncated.
- Integer-valued controls accept decimal strings and decimal/scientific forms such as `001.0`, `10e-1`, and `1.e3`
  only when they represent an exact in-range integer. Nonzero fractional tails, underflow-to-zero, out-of-range values,
  and hexadecimal forms are rejected before writing. These restrictions do not apply to literal text controls.
- Every mutation requires a current snapshot. App/PID/window target flags capture one automatically; without target
  flags, run `peekaboo see` first. A missing snapshot is refused instead of falling through to the frontmost app. Exact
  process/window receipts and the final resolved Accessibility element PID are revalidated before the value is written.
- Remote value mutation requires Bridge protocol 1.37 and `processGenerationBoundElementMutations`; older or
  receiptless hosts are refused before the request is sent.
- Current clients negotiate typed value-verification evidence with capable hosts. Without that evidence, remote
  results retain the legacy exact-string verification contract.
- A result with `requires_fresh_observation: true`, or no canonical outcome, makes that snapshot mutation-ineligible.
  The old evidence stays readable, but another mutation must use a new `peekaboo see` snapshot and otherwise fails
  before dispatch.
- Accepted writes are observed for up to 250 ms to allow apps to publish asynchronous Accessibility updates. Each
  sample revalidates the original field and process generation; the write is never repeated.
- Native samples batch non-value identity metadata to reduce AX round trips, while still checking identity before
  and after reading the value. Unsupported, malformed or generically failed batches retain bounded single-attribute
  reads within the original deadline. The observation budget and security checks are unchanged; batching is not an
  atomic-state guarantee.
- If the Accessibility write is accepted but its readback cannot be verified, Peekaboo reports an indeterminate,
  retry-unsafe result with the exact target receipt. Observe the target again before deciding whether to retry; never
  replay the write against the old snapshot.
- Post-write native value samples require readable security metadata. If `AXSubrole` is unreadable, the reader skips
  the potentially sensitive value; it never falls back to events or replays the accepted write to force confirmation.
  A later readable sample can confirm within the existing 250 ms budget. Otherwise the result stays indeterminate
  and retry-unsafe. Known absent subroles (`noValue` or `attributeUnsupported`) remain supported; this does not change
  the separate pre-dispatch value-reading policy.
- Secure/password fields are rejected; use explicit typing flows for those contexts.
- This is not a replacement for `peekaboo type` when the app needs observable keystrokes, IME handling, autocomplete, or undo grouping.
- JSON and MCP output includes the canonical process-generation `target_identity` and `target_receipt` alongside
  `target`, `actionName`, `oldValue`, `newValue`, and `executionTime`.

## Examples

```bash
peekaboo see --app TextEdit
peekaboo set-value "hello" --on "$ELEMENT_ID" --snapshot <snapshot-id>

peekaboo set-value "42" --on "Search"
```
