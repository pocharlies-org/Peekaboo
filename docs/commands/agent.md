# `peekaboo agent`

`agent` hands a natural-language task to `PeekabooAgentService`, which in turn orchestrates the full toolset (see, click, type, menu, etc.). The command handles session caching, terminal capability detection, progress spinners, and audio capture so you can run the exact same agent loop the macOS app uses.

## Subcommands and options
| Command or flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `run [task]` | Run a task. `run` is the default, so `peekaboo agent "task"` remains valid. |
| `resume [session-id]` | Resume the most recent session, or the exact full session ID, in chat mode. |
| `sessions` | Print cached sessions with full IDs, tasks, lifecycle status, and stored policy maximum; accepts only the global `--json` output switch. |
| `chat [initial-prompt]` | Start the interactive chat loop. |
| `--dry-run` | Emit a deterministic preview of a required text task without calling a model, invoking tools, transcribing audio, or creating a session. Human output names the requested foreground choice, effective UI authority, and automatic desktop-context setting. JSON also includes `automaticDesktopContext`, `uiAuthority.requestedForeground`, `uiAuthority.effectivePolicy`, and `uiAuthority.backgroundOnly` under `result`. |
| `--max-steps <n>` | Cap model turns to `1...100` (default: 100). One turn may contain multiple tool calls. |
| `--model gpt-5.6|gpt-5-mini|claude-opus-5|claude-fable-5|claude-sonnet-5|gemini-3-flash|minimax|minimax-cn/<model>|openrouter/<provider>/<model>|ollama/<model>|lmstudio/<model>` | Override the configured model. Concrete OpenAI and Anthropic selections are preserved; generic `gpt`/`openai` select GPT-5.6 Sol. Input is validated against supported hosted providers and local model providers. |
| `--no-cache` | Run ephemerally without saving a resumable session. Cannot be combined with resume/list flags. |
| `--no-desktop-context` | Skip new automatic desktop-context collection for this run, chat, or resume invocation. Saved conversation history, tool access, and UI authority are unchanged. |
| `--allow-foreground` | Human opt-in for this invocation to use foreground/global UI routes. New sessions persist it as an immutable maximum; each later resume must opt in again. It never exposes the Shell tool. |
| `--quiet` / `--simple` / `--no-color` / `--debug-terminal` | Control output mode; the command auto-detects terminal capabilities when you don’t override it. |
| `--audio` / `--audio-file <path>` | Use microphone input or pipe audio from disk. |

## Implementation notes
- The command resolves output “modes” (`minimal`, `compact`, `enhanced`, `quiet`, `verbose`) using terminal detection heuristics; `--simple` and `--no-color` force minimal mode, while `--quiet` suppresses progress output entirely.
- Session metadata lives inside `agentService` (PeekabooCore). `agent resume` grabs the most recent session, `agent sessions` prints the cached list, and `--no-cache` keeps a run in memory.
- Automatic desktop context is enabled by default. Before model turns it reads the frontmost application/window,
  cursor position, and running-application names; it also reads a clipboard preview when the clipboard tool is available.
  `--no-desktop-context` skips this new collection and injection for every turn of the current invocation, including
  chat and resume. It does not remove desktop information already present in saved conversation history, disable
  model-requested tool observations, restrict tools to one application, or change foreground authority. It is not an
  application sandbox. `--no-cache` remains a separate session-persistence choice; neither flag disables ordinary
  runtime initialization or snapshot/coordination storage.
- Copy the full ID printed by `agent sessions`; shortened prefixes are display hints, not valid resume identifiers. A status
  of `active` means the saved session is resumable, not that a process is currently executing or that the session is
  free for concurrent use. Use one process per session; if another run is using it, wait and retry the same full ID.
- Every new Agent session is background-only by default. Provider and MCP arguments are validated first; the runtime
  then enforces the immutable authority ceiling before dispatch, including foreground aliases, shared-pointer tools,
  focus/activation, foreground capture, global shared system UI mutations, Space switch/follow, persistent clipboard
  writes, browser setup, and browser page fronting. Space listing and unfollowed window moves remain available.
  The pinned browser provider also treats every Puppeteer page evaluation as a user gesture. Background Agent catalogs
  therefore hide page discovery, snapshots, navigation, waits, element interaction, and raw script evaluation, and the
  execution boundary refuses a copied call before provider status or execution. `--allow-foreground` exposes those
  routes and reports them as foreground browser-protocol delivery even when the page is not visibly raised.
  Refusals report `effect: refused`,
  `mutation_dispatched: false`, and `retry_safe: true`.
- Background-only Agent raw `press` requires a fresh exact non-dialog snapshot receipt. Targetless, app/PID-only,
  window-selector-only, and `foreground: true` forms are refused. Its semantic effect is unverifiable, so observe the
  exact target before another mutation.
- Exact targeted `dialog click`, non-forced `dismiss`, and `input` remain available with an explicit app, PID, or
  window target. Click/dismiss use prepared one-shot receipts; input resolves the exact target and uses background
  AXValue. Targetless input, file actions, forced dismiss, and foreground routes remain unavailable.
- `--allow-foreground` is accepted only as human authority. A new session saves foreground permission as its immutable
  maximum, but every later process invocation defaults back to background-only and must pass the flag again. A
  background-only session cannot be broadened on resume, and editing session JSON cannot authorize foreground work.
  Each continuation regenerates its system prompt for the current invocation ceiling, so a stored foreground-capable
  session resumed without the flag does not keep foreground examples or guidance.
- Background-only Agent typing requires an explicit fresh exact non-dialog snapshot; an optional element ID must come
  from that snapshot. Snapshot typing cannot include competing app/PID/window selectors. Direct-text paste
  remains available through a generation-pinned app/PID/window authorization with a canonical background result.
  Targetless, foreground, current-clipboard, and binary paste remain refused.
- Foreground permission never exposes the Shell tool. Normal Agent toolsets omit `shell`, and the execution boundary
  still refuses it after `--allow-foreground`. Foreground UI authority is not a process sandbox: a trusted prompt can
  operate terminal or scripting apps through their UI, so grant `--allow-foreground` only to trusted prompts. Use
  Peekaboo's native app/window/Accessibility/browser tools for UI automation.
- Agent execution stays in the caller process by default. Pass the global `--bridge-socket <path>` option to route its tools through one specific Bridge host; `--no-remote` keeps the run strictly caller-local.
- An explicit nonempty `PEEKABOO_ALLOW_TOOLS` containing only known tools that cannot reach native capture (after
  `PEEKABOO_DISABLE_TOOLS`) skips capture-owner startup checks when automatic visual enhancements are disabled.
  For example, `inspect_ui,click,type,set_value,press` needs no capture-owner probe. Unknown tools, nested `agent`,
  native pixel-producing tools, and absent or blank allow-lists remain conservative. `--no-desktop-context` alone does
  not disable capture safety. Browser-provider screenshots use their existing transport without native capture-owner
  leases. Ordinary host routing, initialization, and snapshot invalidation remain unchanged.
- A Bridge-routed Agent never borrows the host's shared browser root. A browser-filtered Agent run opens no browser
  scope. Each browser-enabled Agent session opens one distinct end-capable remote child and capability namespace; within
  one running Agent service, continuations of the same persistent session reuse that child while different sessions
  remain isolated. Opens and ends coalesce under bounded capacity. Session deletion and ephemeral completion end the
  exact child; unconfirmed cleanup is retained as retryable debt and blocks session reuse until the host confirms it. A
  remote provider without scoped-session support refuses before browser dispatch instead of falling back to shared state.
- Protocol 1.31 qualification can instead ask an eligible Bridge host to launch the exact authenticated Peekaboo CLI
  peer for one fixed background-only `agent run --no-cache --bridge-socket <serving-host> --json` execution. This is one
  long request through terminal `waitpid`, not a public two-call Agent lifecycle. The host accepts the task but no
  executable, shell, AppleScript, JXA, arbitrary argv, or environment input. The CLI blocks at its earliest entry point
  on a host-owned anonymous pipe, so `SIGCONT` alone cannot pass the exact process/code/path and owner-private
  challenge acknowledgement gate. The outer request owns no desktop lane, while each nested tool call owns its exact
  lane and signed receipt. The fixed background toolset omits Shell; process-group cleanup is not a general macOS
  sandbox against a compromised signed CLI or native code that deliberately detaches. A pre-1.31 or
  capability-disabled host refuses before launch, and a response lost after pipe release is retry-unsafe. Its
  qualification-only CLI adapter emits the canonical signed receipt bundle and is deliberately absent from help and
  shell completions; ordinary users should invoke `peekaboo agent` directly.
- An unrelated legacy owner-unaware Bridge does not block Agent startup or non-capturing app/window/Accessibility
  tools through an explicitly selected current Bridge. Pixel-producing calls remain refused before dispatch for that
  process lifetime; after fixing the owner, start a fresh Agent process before retrying capture.
- When another live process holds ScreenCaptureKit, an explicitly selected ready Bridge that proves classic capture
  and request-local engine selection can serve automatic `see` and `image` observations without changing hosts.
  Explicit modern capture and SCK-only `capture live`/`verify_state` final screenshots remain refused before transport
  for that Agent process. Classic fallback does not relax target, snapshot, listener-identity, or signed-result checks.
- Agent executions run under the top-level command runtime, so environment variables, credentials, and logging levels match the top-level CLI state. Text-task dry-run previews bypass runtime construction entirely.
- New configurations select GPT-5.6 and Opus 5. Credential-only Anthropic discovery uses Opus 4.8 for zero-retention compatibility, while saved configuration and session model pins remain unchanged.
- `--dry-run` is a zero-provider text-task preview: it echoes the normalized instruction with explicit zero
  model/tool/session effects. It neither selects nor probes a UI host, so unavailable Bridge sockets, capture owners,
  or UI permissions cannot block a valid preview. A missing task or audio input is invalid instead of entering
  chat/help or transcription; step limits and the Agent-disable switch are still validated.
- Audio flags wire into Tachikoma’s audio stack: `--audio` opens the microphone and `--audio-file` loads a WAV/CAF file.
- Generation uses `agent.temperature` and `agent.maxTokens` from the shared config written by the macOS Settings UI.
  Token requests are capped to model capability; unsupported temperature controls are omitted automatically.
- A run fails when its final permitted turn still requests tools and therefore needs another model turn to interpret
  their results. Already-dispatched actions are not rolled back. Inspect current app state before continuing, and do
  not blindly repeat the task. Unless `--no-cache` is set, the run saves a resumable session; after inspection, resume
  that session rather than starting its actions again. Ephemeral runs cannot be resumed. A larger `--max-steps` budget
  can be selected for a future run or saved-session continuation, but does not make replay safe.
- Native `ollama/<model>` runs replay each assistant tool call and named tool result on the next model turn. Ollama
  support is model-dependent, and native text arrives incrementally with a model-dependent chunk cadence. See the
  [Ollama guide](../providers/ollama.md).
- Native tool observations appear once in Agent context, with action safety metadata and verification receipts
  preserved separately. Existing saved sessions remain readable; this does not compact or discard observation history.

### JSON execution trace

`--json` retains the legacy `result.toolCalls` array for compatibility and adds
`result.executionTrace`. The trace correlates each provider-emitted call ID with its runtime result and reports one of
four dispositions: `executed/succeeded`, `executed/failed`, `skipped-before-dispatch`, or `missing-result`. This lets a
validator distinguish a model's attempted calls from mutations Peekaboo actually dispatched.

`result.content` is unchanged model-generated narrative, and `success: true` reports Agent-run completion, not
confirmation of every action. When the bounded trace contains non-confirmed action outcomes or incomplete outcome
coverage, `result.recordedOutcomeNotice` explains their recorded status. Later observations can verify effects without
rewriting an earlier `dispatched_unverified` outcome. Notice counts cover only retained tool-trace entries, not nested
authenticated receipt bundles; missing or truncated outcomes are never counted as confirmed. The same notice appears
in non-quiet CLI/chat completion output and MCP Agent metadata. Non-quiet MCP output adds a separate text block;
quiet CLI stdout and the MCP Agent's quiet text remain unchanged.

Legacy `result.toolCalls[].arguments` remains a string for compatibility, but that string is now deterministic JSON
derived from the same bounded, privacy-safe argument projection as the execution trace. It never contains Swift type
descriptions or runtime addresses. Calls beyond the trace limit and any call/trace mismatch use
`{"redacted":true}` rather than raw provider arguments.

`executionTrace.entries[].arguments` is a JSON object rather than the legacy string preview. Trace arguments are
bounded and allowlist only audit-relevant targeting, delivery modes, action enums, timeouts, predicate kinds, and safe
boolean controls. Content-bearing and unknown values are represented by typed redaction summaries, including typed or
pasted text, expected values, messages, prompts, shell commands, URLs, open targets, queries, labels, paths, and binary
image data. Field names also follow one closed policy at the top level and inside allowed containers; unknown
provider-authored names become deterministic `__peekaboo_trace_unknown_field_<n>` placeholders in sorted order. Each
`result` is a bounded status summary, not the raw tool payload; screenshot bytes and arbitrary output
text are intentionally omitted. The trace is capped at 512 entries and reports `totalCallCount` plus `truncated` when
calls were omitted.

When the step limit is exhausted, `--json` still exits nonzero with `success: false` and `error.code: AGENT_ERROR`.
Its failure `data` includes `maxSteps`, the same sanitized `executionTrace`, and a `sessionId` only when the session
was saved. It does not emit raw conversation messages or tool payloads, and a partial trace is not task-completion
evidence. On resume the trace includes retained session history, as it does for a successful result.

Tool results blocked by pending snapshot cleanup retain `snapshot_invalidation.tool_executed: false` and
`snapshot_invalidation.retry_tool: true` in Agent metadata. These describe the blocked tool, not permission to replay
an earlier mutation; inspect current state and distinguish cleanup retries from newly dispatched input.
Browser-provider metadata is filtered and namespaced before projection, including results from legacy read-only
clients, so provider-authored cleanup or action claims cannot become Peekaboo-owned receipts.

Mutating trace entries expose `mutationDispatch` as `dispatched`, `not_dispatched`, or `possibly_dispatched`.
`mutation_dispatched` is retained in the bounded result summary only when the tool explicitly reported the legacy
boolean (or Peekaboo itself skipped the call before dispatch). Older or opaque results are `possibly_dispatched`, omit
the legacy boolean, and report `retry_safe: false` so clients do not replay a mutation whose dispatch is unknown.

## Chat mode

Peekaboo now ships a dependency-free interactive chat loop described in detail in `docs/agent-chat.md`. Key behaviors:

- Running `peekaboo agent` without a task automatically enters chat mode when stdout is a TTY. `agent resume [session-id]` also enters chat so piped prompts can continue the saved session.
- `agent chat` forces the loop even when piped or redirected, making it easy for other agents to seed prompts programmatically.
- `/help` is available inside the loop at any time and is printed the moment the loop starts. `/help` is also mentioned in the initial “Type /help…” banner so operators know what to do.
- Pressing `Esc` during an active turn cancels the run immediately and brings you back to the prompt; Ctrl+C still works as a fallback.
- Chat sessions reuse context via the same agent session cache; use `agent resume [session-id]` to hook the loop into an existing conversation.
- Ctrl+C cancels the current turn; pressing it again (while idle) exits the loop. Ctrl+D exits when idle.

For automation flows that cannot attach to a TTY, use `agent chat` with standard input. Session resumes also consume standard input and exit nonzero when a resumed turn fails; explicit `agent chat` keeps the loop alive.

## Examples
```bash
# Let the agent sign into Slack using GPT-5.6 with verbose tracing
peekaboo agent "Check Slack mentions" --model gpt-5.6 --verbose

# Use GPT-5.6 Sol (the gpt-5.6 shortcut selects Sol)
peekaboo agent "Check the current window" --model gpt-5.6

# Use Claude Sonnet 5
peekaboo agent "Check the current window" --model claude-sonnet-5

# Keep the agent loop local through Ollama
peekaboo agent "Check the current window" --model ollama/llama3.3

# Run ephemerally without automatically collecting unrelated desktop context
peekaboo agent run "Inspect the Playground window" --no-cache --no-desktop-context --no-remote

# Use an OpenRouter-hosted model
peekaboo agent "Check the current window" --model openrouter/xiaomi/mimo-v2.5-pro

# Explicitly authorize foreground/global UI for this new resumable session
peekaboo agent "Demonstrate the workflow visibly" --allow-foreground

# Dry-run the same task without executing any tools
peekaboo agent "Install the nightly build" --dry-run

# Resume the most recent session
peekaboo agent resume

# Resume one exact session from the full ID printed by `agent sessions`
peekaboo agent resume 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc

# List cached sessions as JSON
peekaboo agent sessions --json
```

## Troubleshooting
- Verify Screen Recording + Accessibility permissions (`peekaboo permissions status`).
- Confirm your process with `peekaboo app list`, its exact window with `peekaboo window list`, and current UI with `peekaboo see` before rerunning.
- Re-run with `--json` or `--verbose` to surface detailed errors.
