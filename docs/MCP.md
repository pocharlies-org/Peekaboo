# Model Context Protocol (MCP) in Peekaboo

This document explains how Peekaboo exposes its automation tools as an MCP server and how to install it in MCP clients.

## Overview

Peekaboo runs as an MCP server over stdio, exposing its native tools (image, see, click, etc.) to external MCP clients such as Codex, Claude Code, or Cursor.
Peekaboo no longer hosts or manages external MCP servers; configure your MCP client to launch `peekaboo mcp` directly.
By default, the MCP process owns its lifecycle and keeps support services process-local. An explicit
`--bridge-socket <path>` instead attaches MCP tools to that existing Bridge host and skips the embedded support daemon.
In both modes, MCP never publishes `daemon.sock`, `bridge.sock`, or another Bridge listener itself.
The explicit route also owns capture preflight for the server lifetime: Peekaboo reuses one authenticated client bound
to that listener's process generation and does not consult unrelated auxiliary Bridge sockets during caller routing.
Startup verifies that the selected host advertises process ownership. The host then enforces the canonical
ScreenCaptureKit lease at every real SCK leaf by rescanning all same-user potential Peekaboo processes, including
owner-unaware processes that started after acquisition. Caller-local MCP retains the broader legacy-socket scan because
no external Bridge generation owns its capture path.

Snapshots returned by current `see` calls use producer-bound references with the exact form `ps1_` plus 32 lowercase
hexadecimal digits. Follow-up tools carrying that reference stay with its unique authenticated producer; a missing,
ambiguous, incompatible, or unreachable owner is a pre-dispatch refusal, never a reason to recreate the snapshot or
replay the action elsewhere. An explicit MCP `--bridge-socket` remains strict for the server lifetime. See
[Bridge snapshot authority](bridge-host.md#snapshot-authority) for routing and protocol 1.34 capability negotiation.

Action-oriented UI tools include:

- `click`, `scroll`, `type`, and `press` for the background-safe interaction surface.
- `set_value` for direct accessibility value mutation on settable fields and controls.
- `action` for invoking a named accessibility action such as `AXPress`, `AXShowMenu`, or `AXIncrement`.

Inventory is exposed on the nouns: use `app` with `action: "list"` for running applications and `window` with
`action: "list"` plus `app` for window IDs, bounds, off-screen state, and combined-observation eligibility. Each
window line and the response `_meta.windows` row reports `observation_capability`: `combined_eligible` means the exact
combined raster plus AX route is eligible, not guaranteed to return usable AX elements. `pixels_only` includes the stable
`no_matching_accessibility_window` reason and directs the caller to `see` with `no_elements: true`. `unknown` with
`accessibility_enumeration_incomplete` means a timeout or partial AX result could not prove either mode and the caller
must refresh the inventory; `raster_capture_unverified` keeps an AX-only row unknown when stable pixel metadata was not
available. A null capability means the selected host predates this additive inventory evidence. The former generic `list` tool and its
duplicate `server_status` view are not exposed. `menu` supports only application-menu `list` and `click` actions;
status items use the dedicated menubar surface. MCP retains `sleep` because an MCP client may not have shell access.

Call `see` first and pass actionable element IDs through these tools when possible. Element-targeted calls preserve action-first routing; coordinate calls always use the synthetic path. OCR-only text is semantic evidence, not an element-action target.
The same action tools are available to CLI users as `peekaboo set-value` and `peekaboo action`.
`set_value` and `action` are exposed only when their resolved input strategy enables action invocation
(`actionFirst` or `actionOnly`). They are hidden under `synthFirst` or `synthOnly`, because these operations do not
have a synthetic-input equivalent.

Supported transports:

- **stdio**: supported and default.
- **http / sse**: recognized flags, but server transports are not implemented yet.

Applications linking `PeekabooCore` can pass an MCP Swift SDK `Transport` to
`PeekabooMCPServer.serve(transport:)`. The host owns connection setup and transport policy; `serve` waits for
the transport to complete, then disconnects the SDK session and releases its tool context. Startup failures also
disconnect the session and release that context. Shutdown closes tool-call admission, cancels accepted calls, and
waits for them to finish before releasing their context; cancelling the serving task uses the same cleanup path.
Host-provided transports and tool services must cooperate with task cancellation. Use one server instance per accepted connection;
concurrent `serve` calls on the same instance are rejected before connecting a second transport. A successful
return confirms cleanup; incomplete cleanup throws. This entry point does not add a built-in HTTP or SSE server.
For an accepted `NetworkTransport` connection, disable SDK reconnection so a disconnected peer ends the session.

Peekaboo validates numeric arguments before a tool or mutation lane runs. Fields published as `integer` accept exact
whole values (including whole-number JSON doubles and integer strings) but reject fractional, non-finite, and
out-of-range values. Fields published as `number` must be finite. Rejections report `mutation_dispatched: false` and
`retry_safe: true`; an invalid optional value is never treated as omitted or replaced by a default.

The stdio server reserves stdout exclusively for newline-delimited JSON-RPC messages. Tools never stream raw payload
bytes onto that channel. In particular, MCP `clipboard` rejects `outputPath: "-"`; omit `outputPath` for UTF-8 text or
provide a filesystem path for binary clipboard data. The separate CLI `clipboard get --output -` contract is unchanged.

## Analyzing existing image files

The `analyze` tool accepts existing `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and `.webp` files. Image-file analysis accepts
at most **10 MiB (10,485,760 bytes)** of raw file data, including files exactly at that limit. Resize or compress
larger images before retrying. Directories and special files such as FIFOs are rejected before provider dispatch;
ordinary readable regular files, including symlinks and hardlinks to them, remain supported.

The AI service detects PNG, JPEG, GIF, and WebP MIME types from the bytes first, then uses a supported filename
extension when detection is unavailable. Unknown data retains the existing PNG fallback; this is MIME selection,
not image validity checking. Data-only image analysis uses the same byte detection and PNG fallback without
imposing the file-input size limit. The MCP tool's accepted extensions are unchanged.

## Install in MCP clients

Most MCP clients can launch Peekaboo through either the npm package or a local binary.

Use npm when you want the published release:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "peekaboo": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@steipete/peekaboo", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Use a local binary when developing Peekaboo or testing a checkout:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "peekaboo": {
      "command": "/path/to/peekaboo",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

If your client supports environment variables, add provider and logging settings under `env`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "peekaboo": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@steipete/peekaboo", "mcp"],
      "env": {
        "PEEKABOO_AI_PROVIDERS": "openai/gpt-5.6,anthropic/claude-opus-5",
        "PEEKABOO_LOG_LEVEL": "info"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Common environment variables:

- `PEEKABOO_AI_PROVIDERS`: comma-separated provider list.
- `PEEKABOO_LOG_LEVEL`: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or `error`.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key for GPT models.
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Anthropic API key for Claude models.
- `X_AI_API_KEY` or `XAI_API_KEY`: xAI API key for Grok models.
- `PEEKABOO_OLLAMA_BASE_URL` / `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`: native Ollama server base. The Peekaboo-specific variable wins,
  then the Ollama variable, config, and finally `http://localhost:11434`; do not append `/v1`.

## Verify client setup

Run the server manually first:

```
peekaboo mcp
```

Then restart your MCP client and ask it to list available tools or take a screenshot. Peekaboo should expose the same native tools that `peekaboo tools` reports.

## CLI usage

Show help:

```
peekaboo mcp --help
```

Start the server (defaults to stdio):

```
peekaboo mcp
```

Explicit transport:

```
peekaboo mcp serve --transport stdio
```

## Observation Targets

The MCP `image` and `see` tools share target parsing with the desktop observation pipeline:

- omit `app_target`, pass `screen`, or pass `screen:N` for display capture;
- pass `frontmost` for the current foreground app window;
- pass `menubar` for menu-bar capture;
- pass `PID:1234`, `PID:1234:2`, `App Name`, `App Name:2`, or `App Name:Window Title` for app/window capture.

`image` is the cheap screenshot-only tool and accepts `app_target`, `path`, and `format` naming shared with the
observation surface. Use `see` when element detection and snapshot IDs are required. The `press` tool accepts either
`keys: ["cmd+c", "Return"]` for a chord sequence or `key: "c"` plus `modifiers: ["cmd"]` for one chord.

The `see` tool accepts an exact CoreGraphics `window_id` by itself or with an `app_target` naming the owning
application or PID. `inspect_ui` requires that application/PID owner hint. Peekaboo resolves and generation-pins the
real owner before using the ID. Do not combine `window_id` with a window title or index suffix in `app_target`; choose
one window selector so stale inputs cannot redirect work to a sibling window from the same process. `window_id` is a
positive 32-bit integer; strings, fractional numbers, zero, negative values, and out-of-range values fail before
capture or Accessibility traversal begins.

For an explicit `window_id`, `inspect_ui` rejects an empty Accessibility result even when an older host omits truncation
metadata, returning `ACCESSIBILITY_INCOMPLETE` in that case. Existing timeout and truncation diagnostics take precedence.
App and frontmost inspections may still return a successful empty list, even when the host reports the window it inspected.

`see` also accepts the closed `capture_engine` values `auto` (default), `modern`, and `classic`. The choice is carried
in that observation request to the selected host; incapable hosts refuse it before capture. `classic` never enters
ScreenCaptureKit, so it is the safe request-local recovery path when the selected host proves classic but blocks auto/modern
capture. A selected-host owner refusal remains fixed for the MCP process lifetime; update or relaunch that exact host
and start a fresh MCP process before retrying auto/modern capture.

When a different live process holds ScreenCaptureKit, an explicitly selected ready host that proves classic capture
and request-local engine selection can instead serve automatic `see` and `image` observations as classic on that
same authenticated connection. Explicit `modern` and SCK-only capture operations remain refused before transport
for the process lifetime. Missing capabilities, unknown readiness, implicit routing, and caller-local behavior do
not gain this fallback, and a replaced listener requires a fresh runtime.

Every successful MCP `see` response includes the selected raw or annotated screenshot as inline image content. When
multiple calls intentionally share the same `path`, each response still returns pixels owned by its own capture; the
path remains the caller-requested publication destination and therefore contains whichever concurrent write finishes
last.

Set `ocr: true` on `see` to add text recognized locally by Apple Vision on the selected runtime host to the
Accessibility map. OCR is additive, never replaces accessible controls, preserves incomplete-AX warnings and exact
capture receipts, and does not use a provider or network upload. Remote OCR requires a Bridge host advertising
`desktopObservationOCR`; MCP refuses an incapable host before sending the dynamic observation request. Update and
relaunch that host, or use a caller-local MCP runtime when local OCR is intentional. OCR rows include confidence and
global logical bounds, are marked non-actionable, and are refused by element interaction tools. If a deliberate pixel
action is necessary, use explicit coordinates bound to the exact `snapshot`/`coordinate_reference` returned by `see`.

Observation and capture do not activate a target by default. `see` and `inspect_ui` only perform the focus-changing `AXWebArea` retry when `web_focus: true` is supplied. `image` and live `capture` use `capture_focus: "background"` by default; pass `capture_focus: "foreground"` when activating the target is intentional. The legacy `auto` value remains accepted for focus-if-needed compatibility.

Successful `see` and `inspect_ui` responses include optional `_meta.focused_element` when the observation already
proved one focused element. It preserves the existing identity fields (`processIdentifier`, `windowID`, `role`,
optional `title`/`identifier`, and global-logical `frame`, also for ROI captures); it does not invent a snapshot-local
element ID or expose a field value. Missing focus means unknown, including cached or ambiguous observations, not
that the window has no focused element. This metadata adds no AX read, grants no input authority, and does not bypass
normal snapshot or live receiver validation. Native Agent tools retain the same field under `meta.focused_element`.
External MCP clients may not show `_meta` to their model; this addition alone does not guarantee model-visible focus
in those clients, and the observation's text summary is unchanged.

Successful `capture` results bind every retained frame and `contact.png` to capture-session-authored SHA-256 values.
MCP exposes them in `artifact_sha256`; finalization revalidates those bytes, complete PNG decoding and dimensions, and
the exact semantic `metadata.json` result before reporting success.

The MCP `image` tool stores logical 1x captures by default. Pass `scale: "native"` or `retina: true` to request native display pixels. Set `max_dimension` to a positive integer to cap the longest output edge while preserving aspect ratio; inline `format: "data"` captures default to 1500 pixels when no cap is supplied.

### Capture coordinate context

The `image` and `see` tools include an additive, versioned `coordinate_context` object in response `_meta`. It describes how the delivered raster maps to Peekaboo's canonical top-left-origin global display coordinates, which are measured in logical points:

- `logical_bounds`: the capture rectangle in global logical points;
- `delivered_image_size`: the actual raster dimensions returned to the client, after any `max_dimension` resize;
- `native_scale`: the display's native pixel-to-point scale when known;
- `output_scale`: the delivered raster's effective pixel-to-point scale;
- `display` and `window`: the resolved capture identities when available;
- `reference_id`: the snapshot ID for `see` results, or `null` for standalone `image` results.
- `viewport`: present for ROI results, with the full source window, requested/delivered crop rectangles, global crop
  bounds, and uncropped source raster size.

Consumers should check `version` before interpreting the object. Version `1` uses `logical_space: "global_display_points"` and `origin: "top_left"`. To convert an image-local pixel `(px, py)` to a global logical point, scale it against `delivered_image_size` and add the `logical_bounds` origin; do not assume a fixed Retina factor. The fields are additive, so clients that do not understand them can continue ignoring `_meta`.

### Exact-window ROI

MCP `see` accepts `roi: "x,y,width,height"` in top-left-origin, window-local logical points. ROI requires an exact
`window_id` and must create a fresh snapshot, so omit `snapshot`. Peekaboo captures and inspects the generation-pinned
full window, then returns only the pixel-aligned crop. AX/OCR results are filtered to intersecting elements, and
response element frames are clipped and translated into ROI-local logical coordinates. The stored snapshot retains
global frames for element-ID actions.

The response's `coordinate_context.viewport.source_logical_bounds` remains the full window receipt used for freshness
and dispatch validation; `logical_bounds` describes only the delivered crop. `click` with `coordinate_space:
"image_pixels"` or `"normalized"` maps through the crop while still rejecting moved, resized, missing, reused, or
owner-changed windows before dispatch. Reusing the snapshot for a later full-window observation replaces the ROI
mapping and clears stale annotation state.

`image` intentionally has no ROI argument: screenshot-only calls do not create the fresh snapshot/reference binding
required for safe follow-up background coordinates. Use `see` for a crop that will drive automation.

ROI requires Bridge protocol 1.21. CLI host selection and MCP remote dispatch reject older hosts before sending the
request, so a pre-1.21 host cannot ignore the crop or acknowledge only part of the snapshot. After dispatch, the
client also decodes the quarantined raster and checks its real pixel dimensions against the crop receipt before
publishing files or the snapshot. A compatible host must enable desktop observation plus the snapshot-publication
operations used to finalize the validated result. Current clients additionally require the independently negotiated
protocol 1.34 `producerBoundSnapshotReferences` capability before creating or publishing the reference; an old 1.34
host cannot cause the result to be rebound locally.

The `click` and `paste` tools publish flat object schemas without root-level `oneOf`, `allOf`, or `anyOf`, so MCP clients
can forward them to providers such as Anthropic without schema rewriting. Peekaboo enforces cross-field constraints
at runtime before dispatch; the flat catalog does not relax target, receipt, or foreground-consent requirements.

Snapshot-backed `click`, `action`, `set_value`, `scroll`, `type`, and `press` reserve mutation authority in the snapshot's
producer store before focus or input. Pending or consumed snapshots are refused before dispatch. Outcomes requiring
fresh observation, missing canonical outcomes, and unknown completion prevent replay; explicit historical reads remain
available. Confirmed outcomes that do not require fresh observation release the reservation. Modifier-click and
pixel-focus typing retain their existing single host-owned lease. Selector-driven `paste` remains snapshot-independent.

The `click` tool accepts exactly one target shape: `on`, `query`, or `coords`. Runtime validation requires every
background `coords` call to include either `snapshot` or `coordinate_reference`; a PID alone is only a consistency
check and never replaces the receipt. Both fields must be nonempty and identify a fresh exact-window `see` capture.
Pass `coordinate_space: "image_pixels"` for delivered-raster pixels or `coordinate_space: "normalized"` for values
from 0 through 1, plus the snapshot's `reference_id` as `coordinate_reference`. Missing, empty, stale, out-of-bounds,
moved-window, owner-changed, or process-generation-changed references fail before automation. Validation errors include
`mutation_dispatched: false` and `retry_safe: true`, and do not invalidate snapshots as mutations. Foreground global
coordinates remain snapshot-free only with explicit `foreground: true` (or the deprecated `background: false` inverse
alias); either reference opts into capture-context and live-target validation even when `coordinate_space` is omitted.

The `double`, `triple`, `right`, and `middle` click booleans are mutually exclusive; conflicts are rejected before snapshot lookup or dispatch. Background right-, double-, middle-, and triple-clicks use exact PID/window-routed native events without activating the app or moving the physical cursor. Middle/triple require a fresh exact-window snapshot, Event Synthesizing permission, Bridge protocol 1.30, and the `statelessClickVariants` capability; older hosts are refused before the request is encoded. Every event revalidates the normal-layer window owner, process generation, bounds, and point. Since macOS provides no application-level acknowledgment for routed pointer events, successful dispatch responses include `verified: false` and `effect: "unverifiable"`; canonical metadata retains `click_type`, exact target identity/receipt, and three dispatched units for middle or seven for triple. An unprovable or changed route is refused rather than redirected through the desktop-global event tap.

For `click.query`, `wait_for` is a maximum wait in milliseconds (default 5000, maximum 60000). If the current snapshot
has no match, Peekaboo reads a fresh Accessibility tree for that exact window without taking screenshots or focusing
it, and uses the matching observation's fresh element ID. The original window ID, owner process generation, and
bounds stay pinned throughout; a changed target is refused, not adopted. Modifier-click keeps its original screenshot
lease for coordinate authority and uses only the matched point from the fresh tree.
Unmatched and timed-out samples are never stored as snapshots, so polling does not evict existing UI snapshots.
The remaining monotonic budget bounds observation, and a late match never starts a click. An admitted click keeps
its normal completion and retry-safety semantics; `wait_for` does not cancel already-dispatched input. Zero checks
only the current snapshot. A missing `on` ID is snapshot-local and is reported immediately, never remapped to a
later observation.

`click.modifiers` accepts a nonempty unique array of `cmd`, `shift`, and `option`. It is deliberately foreground-only and requires `foreground: true` plus an explicit non-`latest` exact-window screenshot snapshot. Control and right contextual modifier-clicks are refused because restoring the prior foreground would dismiss their result. Bridge protocol 1.33 hosts must advertise `foregroundModifierClickSnapshotLease`; the host leaf then leases the snapshot and owns exact target preflight, one prebuilt modifier-bearing HID mouse sequence that never changes shared keyboard state, and compare-and-swap restoration as one global operation. Response metadata includes `modifiers`, `cursor_restoration`, and `focus_restoration`; restoration reports `preserved_newer_state` when concurrent user or application activity superseded Peekaboo's write.

Default background-only MCP/Agent `type` requires an explicit fresh exact non-dialog snapshot receipt; an optional
element ID must come from that snapshot. Snapshot typing cannot include competing app, PID, or window selectors;
implicit-latest, selector-only, and targetless forms are refused before dispatch. Direct CLI and explicitly
foreground-capable runtimes retain their documented process-targeted typing routes.

`type.coords` adds atomic pixel-focus typing for exact screenshot snapshots. Supply `snapshot`, optional matching `coordinate_reference`, and `coordinate_space` (`global_display_points`, `image_pixels`, or `normalized`). It cannot be combined with `on`, app/PID/window selectors, or foreground delivery. Bridge protocol 1.33 retains the focus-only Accessibility write and every keyboard unit under one process lane and exact target receipt; successful dispatch units equal keyboard units plus the focus write, and any completed prefix is reported retry-unsafe. The focus prelude never presses a button or selects a row, and its confirmation cannot confirm the separate typing leaf. Only deterministic clear-plus-literal typing can promote through an exact private value readback.

Successful `type` responses preserve the typing result's `target_identity` and `target_receipt` in public `_meta`,
including ordinary and pixel-focus typing. Process identities retain the generation as a lossless decimal string;
exact-window identities also retain the window ID. Missing result identity, including untargeted foreground typing,
adds neither field: request selectors are not substituted for a returned target receipt.

Process, exact-window, and pixel-focus type requests containing non-empty text, clear, or editable focused-text keys require Bridge protocol 1.36 and `compositeTypeDelivery`. Direct AX text, selection/deletion keys, and clear each count as one dispatch and zero key presses; event fallback counts only its posted keys, and requests using both mechanisms report composite delivery. Event-only special keys keep their earlier protocol compatibility, while older or capability-missing sessions refuse AX-capable input before focus or text dispatch.

Background-only raw `press` likewise requires an explicit fresh exact non-dialog snapshot. App/PID-only,
window-selector-only, targetless, and foreground forms are refused by policy before dispatch. The exact target and
focused element are revalidated for every chord, but macOS does not acknowledge semantic effect; observe that target
again before another mutation. Direct CLI callers may also use its documented exact-window selector form.

Process-targeted MCP `paste` and element `click` calls retain one application process-generation receipt instead of
relying on a reusable numeric PID. Paste validates before each emitted unit and clicks validate around dispatch. MCP
and Agent foreground-capable or embedded runtimes require Bridge protocol 1.22 for process-only typed routes; default
background MCP/Agent never selects that route. Older hosts are rejected before input rather than being allowed to
ignore the receipt.

The MCP `paste` tool also keeps window selectors exact in background mode. With `window_id`, `window_title`, or
`window_index`, it resolves one window and carries that window's ID, owner PID, and bounds into the atomic keyboard
dispatch; it never degrades the request to process-only delivery that could reach a sibling window. Direct text
revalidates the exact focused destination throughout typing and never touches the clipboard. If process-targeted or
exact-window direct text fails or is cancelled after dispatch begins, a prefix may already have been inserted;
Peekaboo returns `paste_outcome: "indeterminate"`, `partial_text_possible: true`, `retry_safe: false`,
`clipboard_mutated: false`, and `requires_fresh_observation: true`, with `characters_typed: null` rather than guessing
the delivered prefix length when the input receipt cannot provide one. When the receipt does contain an emitted-unit
count, `characters_typed` reports that lower bound. Rich/binary and current-clipboard payloads require the same
exact-window capability before clipboard mutation or Cmd+V dispatch, then return the normal retry-unsafe
may-have-pasted result because macOS does not acknowledge receiver consumption.

Pointer tools use an explicit interruption policy. `scroll` is background-safe only when `on` identifies an Accessibility-scrollable element or a pixel-backed opaque group in a fresh exact-window snapshot of a visible WebKit-linked app. The latter uses PID-routed wheel events, reports an unverifiable retry-unsafe effect, and refuses Electron/Chromium/Catalyst or stale targets instead of falling back to the shared cursor. Set `foreground: true` for targetless, smooth, or delayed scrolling. `move` and `drag` always manipulate the shared physical cursor, require explicit foreground consent, and abort if a requested target cannot be focused. Default background-only MCP and Agent catalogs omit both tools entirely; use their direct CLI commands when foreground interaction is intentional.

Background process mutations resolve application selectors through the complete mutation inventory before rewriting them to a generation-pinned PID. Exact case-insensitive names, exact bundle IDs, and explicit PIDs are accepted; fuzzy partial application names are refused before the tool leaf runs. Read-only application/window discovery keeps its fuzzy compatibility behavior.

MCP `menu` foreground click and list plan one exact application/window authority before focus. Path and named clicks carry that PID and process generation through dispatch, while foreground listing rejects a returned menu tree whose owner generation changed. If menu access fails after focus, the response retains the focus outcome and exact window receipt. Background menu listing remains read-only and keeps fuzzy selector compatibility.

```json
{
  "coords": "300,220",
  "coordinate_space": "image_pixels",
  "coordinate_reference": "snapshot-id-from-exact-window-see"
}
```

Use the shared physical pointer only with explicit foreground consent:

```json
{
  "coords": "300,220",
  "foreground": true
}
```

Atomic background pixel-focus typing:

```json
{
  "text": "hello",
  "coords": "320,180",
  "coordinate_space": "image_pixels",
  "snapshot": "snapshot-id-from-exact-window-see"
}
```

Explicit foreground modifier-click with restoration reporting:

```json
{
  "on": "captured-element-id",
  "snapshot": "snapshot-id-from-exact-window-see",
  "foreground": true,
  "modifiers": ["cmd", "shift"]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure Screen Recording + Accessibility permissions are granted (`peekaboo permissions status`).
- The `permissions` tool reads one complete snapshot from the selected execution host. Missing Screen Recording or
  Accessibility is a tool failure; missing Event Synthesizing remains a structured limitation for background keyboard
  and foreground synthetic pointer actions rather than a global failure.
- If the MCP client cannot connect, confirm you are launching Peekaboo with `mcp` or `mcp serve` and that the client is using stdio transport.
- Use absolute binary paths for local checkouts.
- Confirm the binary is executable (`chmod +x /path/to/peekaboo`).
- Set `PEEKABOO_LOG_LEVEL=debug` while diagnosing startup issues.
- Check Peekaboo logs with `./scripts/pblog.sh -f` from a source checkout.
