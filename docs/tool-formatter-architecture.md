# Tool Formatter Architecture

## Overview

Tool formatting is owned by `PeekabooAgentRuntime` and shared with the Mac app. The live implementation is under:

```text
Core/PeekabooCore/Sources/PeekabooAgentRuntime/ToolFormatting/
```

## Architecture Components

### Shared Components

- `ToolType` is the type-safe list of formatter-facing tool names, display names, icons, and categories.
- `ToolFormatter` defines starting, completion, error, compact-summary, result-summary, and title formatting.
- `BaseToolFormatter` provides fallback behavior.
- `ToolFormatterRegistry` creates and routes formatters for every `ToolType`.
- `ToolEventSummary` extracts stable summaries from structured tool results before formatter-specific fallback.
- `ToolResultExtractor` and `FormattingUtilities` normalize wrapped values and shared display operations.
- `Formatters/` contains the application, communication, dock, element, menu/dialog, system, UI automation, vision, and window formatter families.

Duration displays use `FormattingUtilities.formatDetailedDuration`; formatter subclasses share the base truncation helper.

Double-to-integer display conversion is owned by `ToolResultExtractor`. Unrepresentable or non-finite optional numbers
are omitted, with count/pointer truncation and element-frame nearest rounding preserved. Container lookup remains
consumer-specific: pointer summaries do not gain string or wrapped-coordinate support. A supplied but unusable shell
exit code is reported as unavailable, not as success; the legacy absent-exit-code fallback remains unchanged.

The registry is available as `ToolFormatterRegistry.shared` or as a separately initialized registry in tests.

### Mac App Consumption

The Mac app does not maintain its own formatter registry:

- `Apps/Mac/Peekaboo/Core/ToolFormatterBridge.swift` parses JSON arguments/results and delegates to `ToolFormatterRegistry`.
- `Apps/Mac/Peekaboo/Features/Main/ToolFormatter.swift` is a compatibility facade for compact summaries and shared formatting utilities.

Unknown tool names fall back to a title-cased name and raw/pretty-printed JSON rather than being added to a parallel Mac-only stack.

Compatibility shortcut summaries tokenize whole key names case-insensitively, so names containing `enter` or `delete`
are not rewritten as key symbols. Forward delete (`forwarddelete`/`forward_delete`, ⌦) stays distinct from backward
delete (`delete`/`backspace`/`del`, ⌫), including the single-key fallback. These are display rules, not keyboard parsing
or delivery changes; current structured tool summaries take precedence over compatibility formatter fallback.

## Adding a New Tool

1. Add the formatter-facing name to `ToolType`.
2. Add or extend the appropriate formatter under `ToolFormatting/Formatters/`.
3. Register the type in `ToolFormatterRegistry.registerAllFormatters()`. Unregistered types receive a category-based default formatter, but explicit routing documents the intended family.
4. Add focused registry/formatter tests under `Core/PeekabooCore/Tests`.
5. Verify both agent output and the Mac facade if the new result shape is user-visible there.

Example lookup:

```swift
let formatter = ToolFormatterRegistry.shared.formatter(for: .launchApp)
let summary = formatter.formatResultSummary(result: resultDictionary)
```

## Best Practices

- Use `ToolResultExtractor` for values that may be direct or wrapped.
- Keep compact summaries short and deterministic.
- Put shared policy in `PeekabooAgentRuntime`; Mac files should remain adapters.
- Prefer `ToolEventSummary` for canonical structured results, then fall back to the registered formatter.
- Test the actual dictionary keys emitted by the tool rather than synthetic result shapes.
