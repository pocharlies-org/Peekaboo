# Configuration & Environment Variables

## Precedence

Peekaboo resolves settings in this order (highest → lowest):

1. Command-line arguments
2. Environment variables (never copied into files)
3. Credentials file (`~/.peekaboo/credentials`: API keys or OAuth tokens)
4. Configuration file (`~/.peekaboo/config.json`)
5. Built-in defaults

## Available Options

| Setting | Config File | Environment Variable | Description |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|-------------|
| AI Providers | `aiProviders.providers` | `PEEKABOO_AI_PROVIDERS` | Comma-separated list (`openai/gpt-5.6,anthropic/claude-opus-5,grok/grok-4.3,ollama/llava:latest`). First healthy provider wins. |
| Agent Model | `agent.defaultModel` | `PEEKABOO_AGENT_MODEL` | Default model for `peekaboo agent`; CLI `--model` wins. |
| Agent Temperature | `agent.temperature` | - | Sampling temperature shared by the app and CLI (default `0.7`); clamped or omitted for models that restrict it. |
| Agent Max Tokens | `agent.maxTokens` | - | Requested output-token budget shared by the app and CLI (default `16384`, accepted range `1...128000`); clamped to provider capability. |
| OpenAI API Key | credentials file | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Required for OpenAI models. |
| Anthropic API Key | credentials file | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Required for Claude models (API-key path). |
| Anthropic OAuth | credentials file | `ANTHROPIC_REFRESH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_ACCESS_EXPIRES` | Created by `config login anthropic`; no API key stored. |
| Grok API Key | credentials file | `GROK_API_KEY` / `X_AI_API_KEY` / `XAI_API_KEY` | Required for Grok (xAI). Env alias resolves to Grok. |
| Gemini API Key | credentials file | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Required for Gemini. |
| MiniMax API Key | credentials file | `MINIMAX_API_KEY` | Required for MiniMax international; also works as fallback for MiniMax China. |
| MiniMax China API Key | credentials file | `MINIMAX_CN_API_KEY` | Optional China-specific key for `minimax-cn/...` models. |
| Kimi API Key | credentials file | `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` / `KIMI_API_KEY` | Required for Kimi models; `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` takes precedence. |
| Ollama URL | `aiProviders.ollamaBaseUrl` | `PEEKABOO_OLLAMA_BASE_URL`, `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` | Native Ollama server base; precedence is Peekaboo env, Ollama env, config, then `http://localhost:11434`. Do not append `/v1`. |
| Default Save Path | `defaults.savePath` | `PEEKABOO_DEFAULT_SAVE_PATH` | Directory for screenshots (supports `~`). |
| Log Level | `logging.level` | `PEEKABOO_LOG_LEVEL` | `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal` (default `info`). |
| Log Path | `logging.path` | `PEEKABOO_LOG_FILE` | Custom log destination (default `/tmp/peekaboo-mcp.log` for MCP; CLI uses stderr). |
| CLI Binary Path | - | `PEEKABOO_CLI_PATH` | Override bundled CLI when testing custom builds. |
| GameBridge manifest budget | - | `PEEKABOO_GAMEBRIDGE_MAX_MANIFEST_BYTES` | Optional positive byte limit for Firestaff accessibility manifests. Unset or empty preserves unlimited size; invalid values disable GameBridge detection. |
| Auto daemon socket | - | `PEEKABOO_DAEMON_SOCKET` | Override the socket used for auto-started daemons (mainly tests/dev). |
| Auto daemon idle timeout | - | `PEEKABOO_DAEMON_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | Seconds before an auto-started daemon exits while idle (default 300). |
| Tool allow-list | `tools.allow` | `PEEKABOO_ALLOW_TOOLS` | CSV or space list. If set, only these tools are exposed (env replaces config). |
| Tool deny-list | `tools.deny` | `PEEKABOO_DISABLE_TOOLS` | CSV or space list. Always removed; env list is additive with config. |
| UI input strategy | `input.*` | `PEEKABOO_INPUT_STRATEGY` and per-verb variants | Choose action invocation versus synthetic input. Built-in policy uses `actionFirst` for click/scroll/background typing and `synthFirst` for legacy SDK typing/hotkey. |
| Element detection boxes | `visualizer.elementDetectionEnabled` | `PEEKABOO_VISUAL_ELEMENT_BOXES` | Draw a bounding box per accessibility element during `peekaboo see`. Default `false` (visually noisy); env var overrides config. The Peekaboo.app settings toggle writes the same config key. |

## GameBridge manifest budget

Set `PEEKABOO_GAMEBRIDGE_MAX_MANIFEST_BYTES=1048576` to limit Firestaff manifests to 1 MiB.
The limit is inclusive and applies before loading or decoding the file, including growth after opening.
An oversized or invalid manifest is ignored and normal Accessibility detection can proceed.
Firestaff must publish immutable frames by atomic rename; detected size or timestamp changes are refused.
Unset or empty keeps the existing unlimited-size default.

The environment belongs to the process performing detection. Use `--no-remote` for a standalone CLI invocation,
or set the variable when starting the Bridge host. A CLI environment override is not forwarded to an already-running host.

## API Key Storage

1. **Environment variables** – supported for existing automation, but keep values out of command arguments.
2. **Credentials file** – `peekaboo config credential set OPENAI_API_KEY` prompts without echo and stores the value in `~/.peekaboo/credentials` (`chmod 600`). Scripts should pipe one line with `--credential-stdin --no-input` or use an owner-only `--credential-file`.
3. **Config file** – avoid storing keys here unless absolutely necessary. OAuth tokens are never written to `config.json`.

The macOS app and CLI use this same file as the ongoing authority for saved API keys, including when
`PEEKABOO_CONFIG_DIR` changes the configuration root. Settings reloads it when the provider pane opens;
use **Reload keys** after a CLI rotation while the pane stays open. There is no credential-path Keychain
storage or importer and no password or biometric prompt for app credential persistence.

The directory is owner-only (`0700`) and the file is owner-readable/writable (`0600`), including temporary
files before publication. This deliberately accepts file-level protection to avoid authentication prompts:
the keys are plaintext, and other processes running as your user can read them. Do not share this file.
Sequential app/CLI edits preserve unrelated keys and OAuth entries; concurrent edits by separate processes,
including Tachikoma, are not serialized.

Old app preferences are never imported automatically, even if the file is missing, empty, or deleted.
**Import saved app keys** explicitly recovers legacy-only keys; existing file values win, including CLI
changes made since the pane opened. Successful saves, clears, and imports retire only the corresponding
legacy entries. Failed imports leave those entries available for another explicit attempt.
Showing a credential field or receiving an unchanged binding value never saves the draft or retires legacy keys.
App edits and legacy imports trim surrounding whitespace and newlines; interior newlines and NUL remain invalid. Whitespace-only app input clears a populated field but leaves an already empty field unchanged; blank legacy entries remain stored without offering recovery.

A failed save keeps the draft marked **Not saved** and leaves the previous effective credential unchanged.
A failed clear does not claim deletion or environment fallback. **Retry** is explicit after failure, and
reload preserves failed drafts. A durability warning means publication already happened; reload to check
instead of blindly repeating the write. Environment overrides, config fallbacks, OAuth sessions, and the
international MiniMax fallback for MiniMax China remain runtime-only and are not implicitly saved.

## Provider Variables

- `PEEKABOO_AI_PROVIDERS`: `provider/model` CSV. Example: `openai/gpt-5.6,anthropic/claude-opus-5,grok/grok-4.3,ollama/llava:latest`.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GROK_API_KEY` | `X_AI_API_KEY` | `XAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `MINIMAX_API_KEY`, `MINIMAX_CN_API_KEY`, `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` | `KIMI_API_KEY`: required for their respective providers when using API keys.
- Ollama native endpoint precedence: `PEEKABOO_OLLAMA_BASE_URL` > `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` >
  `aiProviders.ollamaBaseUrl` > `http://localhost:11434`. Set the server base without `/api/chat` or `/v1`; see the
  [Ollama provider guide](providers/ollama.md#endpoint-selection).

## Defaults & Paths

- `PEEKABOO_DEFAULT_SAVE_PATH`: screenshot destination (created automatically).
- `PEEKABOO_CLI_PATH`: point Peekaboo at a debug build (`.build/debug/peekaboo`) without copying binaries around.

## Agent generation settings

The macOS Settings UI and `peekaboo agent` share `agent.temperature` and `agent.maxTokens` through
`~/.peekaboo/config.json`:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "defaultModel": "anthropic/claude-fable-5",
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "maxTokens": 128000
  }
}
```

`maxTokens` is an upper request, not a promise: Peekaboo clamps it to the selected model's advertised output limit.
Fable 5 supports up to 128K output and a 1M context window. Anthropic-compatible custom providers inherit known
Fable limits from the model ID, while custom model entries can advertise their own `maxTokens`.

Temperature is clamped to `0...1` for Anthropic-compatible models and `0...2` elsewhere. Peekaboo omits it entirely
for models that reject sampling controls, including GPT-5-compatible endpoints and current Anthropic adaptive-thinking
models.

## UI Input Strategy

Input strategy controls whether UI interactions use accessibility action invocation or synthetic input. The built-in
policy keeps the global default, legacy SDK typing, and hotkey at `synthFirst`, selects `actionFirst` for click,
scroll, and background typing,
and exposes `setValue`/`performAction` as action-only operations. An explicit global strategy overrides the built-in
click/scroll/type preferences unless a more specific configured override wins.

Precedence is `--input-strategy` CLI flag, then environment, then config file, then built-in default. The CLI flag forces local execution because the current bridge protocol does not forward per-call strategy overrides.

Valid values:

- `actionFirst`: try accessibility action invocation, fall back to synthetic input when unsupported.
- `synthFirst`: use synthetic input first.
- `actionOnly`: use action invocation only.
- `synthOnly`: use synthetic input only.

For background typing, `actionOnly` forbids keyboard events and both synthetic strategies skip AX value/selection
edits. `actionFirst` falls back per unsupported unit, never after an accepted or uncertain write. Local native text
edits can work with Accessibility alone; local Event Synthesizing permission is checked only before needed events.
Bridge-hosted targeted typing still requires Post Event permission at admission, including native edits.

The legacy SDK `type(text:target:clearExisting:typingDelay:snapshotId:)` keeps its shipped `synthFirst` default,
including named-target focus and per-character keyboard delivery. Default calls do not probe AX replacement
eligibility. Explicit global, type, and per-app strategies retain their existing precedence on both SDK and
background paths. Direct AX replacement under an explicitly selected action strategy requires
`clearExisting: true`, zero `typingDelay`, and a fresh check proving the named target is the current keyboard
receiver; cached focus or a frontmost app/window alone is insufficient.
A requested positive delay or a successfully read focus mismatch makes the action route unsupported:
`actionFirst` uses the existing synthetic focus/clear/type path, while `actionOnly` refuses without dispatch.
An unreadable or uncertain focus check instead stops before input under either action strategy, without fallback.
Permission failures, `cannotComplete`, missing or malformed focus values, and timeouts are errors, not evidence
that the target is unfocused. Explicit `synthFirst` and `synthOnly` retain their existing synthetic behavior.
These SDK eligibility checks do not change the global/per-app strategy precedence or the CLI foreground
action-array path.

Zero-delay SDK replacement also requires bounded, same-process ancestry proving a native rather than web
receiver. Known `AXWebArea` descendants take the existing keyboard route under `actionFirst` and refuse under
`actionOnly`, before any AX value write; unprovable ancestry instead stops without input or fallback.
This avoids treating AX value readback as proof of page input-event behavior and leaves explicit `set-value`
semantics unchanged.

Config example:

```json
{
  "input": {
    "defaultStrategy": "synthFirst",
    "click": "actionFirst",
    "scroll": "actionFirst",
    "type": "actionFirst",
    "hotkey": "synthFirst",
    "setValue": "actionOnly",
    "performAction": "actionOnly",
    "perApp": {
      "com.googlecode.iterm2": {
        "hotkey": "synthOnly"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Environment variables:

- `PEEKABOO_INPUT_STRATEGY`
- `PEEKABOO_CLICK_INPUT_STRATEGY`
- `PEEKABOO_SCROLL_INPUT_STRATEGY`
- `PEEKABOO_TYPE_INPUT_STRATEGY`
- `PEEKABOO_HOTKEY_INPUT_STRATEGY`
- `PEEKABOO_SET_VALUE_INPUT_STRATEGY`
- `PEEKABOO_PERFORM_ACTION_INPUT_STRATEGY`

CLI override:

```bash
peekaboo click --on "$ELEMENT_ID" --input-strategy actionFirst
```

## Logging & Troubleshooting

- `PEEKABOO_LOG_LEVEL=debug` (or `trace`) surfaces verbose input-path logs.
- `PEEKABOO_LOG_FILE=/tmp/peekaboo.log` persists logs for sharing.
- Tool filters: env `PEEKABOO_ALLOW_TOOLS` replaces config `tools.allow`; env `PEEKABOO_DISABLE_TOOLS` is additive with `tools.deny`. Deny wins if a tool appears in both. See [docs/security.md](security.md) for examples and risk guidance.

## Setting Variables

```bash
# Single command
PEEKABOO_AI_PROVIDERS="ollama/llava:latest" peekaboo see --analyze "Describe this UI" --path img.png

# Session exports
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
export X_AI_API_KEY="xai-..."

# Shell profile
echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."' >> ~/.zshrc
```

When in doubt, run `peekaboo config show --effective` to see the merged view from every layer.
